# warp10-udf-riak-ts
This project correspond to a [Warp 10 UDF](http://www.warp10.io/reference/miscellaneous/UDF/#sidebar) to load GTS from Riak-ts tables.

## Usage
This function takes 4 parameters as entry: a riak url, a riak port, a column map and a riak query.
The column map correspond to the column from the result table generated by the query. Timestamp and class field are mandatory. 
For each key, associate the position in the table (Starting from 0). 
For the class field and the labels field, the value correspond to a map with the position as key, and the wanted name in Warp10 as value.
Here a small example is given. As there is no escape in Warp Script, to put a "'" the hexadecimal code "%27" is used.
```
'127.0.0.1' // riak URL 
8087        // riak Port
            // A map
{
    'timestamp' 2
    'class' 
    {
        3 'class1'
        4 'class2'
    }
    'labels'
    {
        0 'status'
        1 'family'
    }
    'elevation' 5
    'latitude'  6
    'longitude' 7
}
            // A query
'select *  from table where ts > 1 and ts < 3 and status=%27OK%27'
'io.warp10.riakts.LOADFROMRIAK' UDF
```
